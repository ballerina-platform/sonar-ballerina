<p>
    Operating systems often have global directories with write access granted to any user.
    These directories serve as temporary storage locations like /tmp in Linux-based systems.
    However, when an application manipulates files within these directories, it becomes vulnerable to race conditions on filenames.
    A malicious user may attempt to create a file with a predictable name before the application does.
    If successful, such an attack could lead to unauthorized access, modification, corruption, or deletion of other files.
    This risk escalates further if the application operates with elevated permissions.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>

<pre>
string tempFolderPath = os:getEnv("TMP");
check file:create(tempFolderPath + "/" + "myfile.txt");
check file:getAbsolutePath(tempFolderPath + "/" + "myfile.txt");
check file:createTemp("suffix", "prefix");
check file:createTempDir((), "prefix");
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>

<p>
    Use dedicated sub-folders.
</p>
<pre>
check file:create("./myDirectory/myfile.txt");
check file:getAbsolutePath("./myDirectory/myfile.txt");
</pre>
